# Delete Me!

**First Bank of Pig**

*Last updated: February 2026*

Your data remains in our database as long as you use the app. To delete your
data, you can:

- Remove individual children or transactions from within the app
- Delete your entire family and all its data using the "Delete Family"
  option in the menu (available to the family owner)

Temporary data such as invite codes and device lookup codes expire
automatically (24 hours and 1 hour respectively) and are cleaned up
periodically.

## Contact

If you have questions about data deletion, you can either open an issue on
the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/joeyparrish/first-bank-of-pig/issues)
or contact the developer at
[support@chickennoodlesoap.com](mailto:support@chickennoodlesoap.com).
